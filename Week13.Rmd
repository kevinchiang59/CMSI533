#Question 1
```{r read1}
stack_df <- read.table("stack.df.csv",header = T, sep = ",")
```
# a. generating a summary of the data
First get the general summary
```{r}
summary(stack_df)
```
Next get the correlation matrix
```{r}
cor(stack_df)
```

```{r}
stack.df %>%
  summarise_all((sd))
```

```{r}
q1fit1 <- lm(stack_loss ~ Air_Flow + Water_Temp + Acid_Conc, data = stack_df)
summary(q1fit1)
```
y=B_1*X_1+B_2*X_2+B_3*X_3+E
One way to interpret it is that we would expect a one unit increase in stack_loss for every 0.7156 unit increase in Air_Flow, 1.2953 unit increase in Water_Temp, or -0.1521 unit decrease in Acid_Conc, and the multivariate linear model is pretty strong given that the R-squared values are approximately 0.9
